Based on the previous Analysis Phase output, implement the following: [Paste the Improvements suggestions here from the Analysis Phase]. Then proceed with the updates below.

When you are done:
- **Update Roadmap:** Update the existing roadmap.md file (or create new if it doesn't exist) based on your findings and plan it step by step in an optimal order, keeping track of your progress by editing this file.
- **Update Features:** Update or create features.md to include a list of features used in this code; don't use project-specific names or descriptions but describe it in a general yet specific way that can be used for learnings and inspiration in another project coded with Grok Code Fast 1; per feature, note the function names specific for the feature.
- **Commit Title:** Prepare title text to copy and paste in the input field in VS Code, output it as the last thing every step so I can use it for committing the changes if I choose to implement your suggestions, formatted in a way I can copy it easily.

Tests:
- **Update Tests:** Run the tests (add new if needed) and fix the issues. Validate suggestions via tests or builds, and iterate if needed to ensure error handling and reliability.
